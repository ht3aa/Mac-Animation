(The video and the idea was taken from this site https://rauno.me/)

## How to use it
1. Download the repo and add the macNavAnimation.js file to your project.
2. Make an html file.
3. Add this script to the end of the body tag.
```html
<script src="macNavAnimation.js"></script>
```
4. Make an element (prefer a div or ul element) and give it a block class.
5. Add children to that element as many as you want (the animation will be applied to these children).
just like this:
```html
    <ul class="block">
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        ....
        ....
    </ul>
```
6. Style the parent element and its children as you want.

And you have done it. hope the animation satisfies your needs ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•.
